# fQCP
Fortran version of Quaternion Characteristic Polynomial (QCP) superposition method
translated from C by Naoto Hori.  The original code was written by Douglas L. Theobald
and Pu Liu, and distirubuted under a BSD open source license at http://theobald.brandeis.edu/qcp .

QCP is a method to calculate RMSD and rotation matrix for superpositioning.

Following is the original notice for the original code written in C
by Theobald and Liu, distributed at http://theobald.brandeis.edu/qcp
